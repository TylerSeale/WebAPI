===============================
===============================

Request headers:

- No headers shown, but there are contents in Raw

1) GET https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=turing HTTP/1.1

GET does not modify, create, or delete anything. GET only requests information. The URL is where we define the location and query parameters. The HTTP/1.1 is the protocol and protocol version


2) Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate

This shows the excepted compression scheme


3) Host: www.googleapis.com

Name of the domain we are reaching out to


4) Connection: Keep-Alive

Shows the connection used. Keep-Alive means a single connection for multiple requests/responses.


5) User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.1.1 (java 1.5)

Response headers / Values:

1) ETag    "_rmWcTkH-s1QFjg9mC3Xel0FZSQ/gJIX7X5fuhQunJhy7nw4svzBJks"

This is one of the ways http requests handle web cache validation. If the content has not changed, the value will be the same and the full response will not be resent.

4) X-XSS-Protection    1; mode=block

Monitors if any of the suspicious parameters that the browser sends to a website come back in the response decoded. It prevents script injection if the mode is set to block, which in this case it is.
